### What is a Margin of Error ?
A margin of error tells you how many percentage points your results 
will differ from the real population value. For example, a 95% confidence 
interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be within 
4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time.




### The Margin of Error Formula

    Margin of Error = (σ / (√n)) * z
    
    phat= sample proportion (“P-hat”)
    n = sample size
    z = z-score



### Functions Used in the Confidence Interval:

   * Multiplication
   * Division
   * Square Root
   * Standard Deviation

### What is a Mode?

The **mode** is the number that is most common in a group of numbers.

### The Mode Formula

There is no formula to determine **mode**.  The best practice is to place the numbers in order so that you can clearly see patterns.

### Example

Find the **mode** in the below group of numbers.
 
   2, 19, **34**, **34**, **34**, 41, 46, 69, 86, 100, 101

Mode = 34

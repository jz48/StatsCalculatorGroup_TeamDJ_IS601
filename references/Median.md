### What is a Median?

The median is the middle point of a set of numbers. To find the median, list the data points in ascending order and then find the middle number.

For example, 23 is the **median** in the below list of numbers.

    15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 26, 30, 31, 33

### The Median Formula

Finding the Median does not require a formula, unless you have an even set of numbers.  In this case, you should find the middle two points and average them.

### Example Equation

15, 17, 18, 20, **23**, **26**, 30, 31, 33

Median = (23+26)/2
Median = 24.5
